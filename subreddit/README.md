# About these Markdown files

This is the canonical source for /u/Yangchenghu's series of Reddit posts on
[/r/UniversityOfLondonCS](https://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityOfLondonCS). Each
post is an explanatory document or guide to some aspect of the programme, or
student life in general.

Note that while /u/Yangchenghu has made other posts on the subreddit, this
repository will only hold the in-depth guides and documents.

Future posts will be released first on
[/r/UniversityOfLondonCS](https://www.reddit.com/r/UniversityOfLondonCS), and
then added to REPL on the same day.
